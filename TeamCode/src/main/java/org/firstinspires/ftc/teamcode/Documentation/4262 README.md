# Test

OpModes in the Test package are intended to assert proper behavior of any/all components of the
robot. Each OpMode in Test package contains factors only related to its test subject.

* I.e.
    * TestColorSensor contains factors only related to the color sensor.
    * TestGamepads contains factors only related to the gamepads.
    * Etc. This allows us to identify any problem(s) while debugging.

      interesting.
